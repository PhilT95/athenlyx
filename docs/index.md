# Welcome to Athenlyx.com

This is a collection of documentations, guides and How-To's for Infrastructure Management as well as Cyber Security and its tools.

The documentation is divided into:

- [**Blue Teaming**](blue/index.md)
- [**Applications**](applications/index.md)
- **Servers**
- **AI**


Athenlyx.com and the infrastructure behind it is based on an **Open-Source Stack**. It is used as an example that open source products can be combined to host and publish websites and services securely without the need for closed source and licensing.

# About Me
I'm Phil and I'm an IT and Cyber Security specialist located in Germany. I use this website to document my knowledge about various IT Infrastructure and cyber security related topics using my markdown documentation and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you want to know more about this website and how it is setup, please refer to the [Hompage](../index.md) or the [MkDocs Setup Guide](../applications/mkdocs/mkdocs.md).


I am currently going through the SOC Level 1 [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) Learning path and I'm adding what I learned to this documentation as well.

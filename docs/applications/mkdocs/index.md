**MkDocs** is a great tool to transform your markdown documentation into a light-weight website to share it with the world or to just make browsing the documents easier and faster. Especially with frameworks like [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) you can create a modern looking and feeling website like this. 

If you want to know how this website has been setup or you want to set up your own website, just follow [this Guide](mkdocs_setup.md).

# About Me
I'm Phil and I'm an IT and Cyber Security specialist located in Germany. I use this website to document my knowledge about various IT Infrastructure and cyber security related topics using my markdown documentation and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).


I am currently going through the SOC Level 1 [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) Learning path and I'm adding what I learned to this documentation as well.

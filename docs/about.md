# About Me
I'm Phil and I'm an IT and Cyber Security specialist located in Germany. I use this website to document my knowledge about various IT and cyber security related topics using my markdown documentation and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)


I am currently going through a lot of [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) courses where I try to condense the information.
